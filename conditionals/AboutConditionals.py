                        Conditionals

By default, statements in Python script are executed sequentially from top to bottom.
If the processing logic require so,
the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two way:

1.Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true
                        eg: if,if-else,if-elif-else,nested,switch,ternary

2.Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as long as a certain expression is true.
                        eg: for , while loops


 In this section, we will cover if, else, elif statements.
 The comparison and logical operators we learned in previous sections will be useful here.
