"""
Inplace  operators behave similarly to normal operators except that they act in different manner
in case of mutable and immutable targets

normal operators add() method --> a+b and stores the result in the mentioned variable
implace operators add() method --> a+= b (not applicable for immutable objects)


The _add_ method, does simple addition, takes two arguments, returns the sum, and stores it in another variable without modifying any of the arguments.

On the other hand, _iadd_ method also takes two arguments, but it makes an in-place change in 1st argument passed by storing the sum in it. As object mutation
is needed in this process, immutable targets such as numbers, strings, and tuples, shouldnâ€™t have _iadd_ method.
