"""
In python there are 7 logic gates present in python

1.AND Gate --> output = 1 , both input = 1 , else 0
2.NAND Gate --> output = 0, if both input = 1, viceversa
3.OR Gate  --> output = 1, if one of input = 1, viceversa
4.XOR Gate  --> output = 1 , if either of input is different
5.NOT Gate  --> It acts as an inverter. It takes only one input. gives 0 otherwise
                If the input is given as 1, it will invert the result as 0 and vice-versa.

6.NOR Gate  --> output = 1, both input are 0.it gives output 0 otherwise
7.XNOR Gate  --> gives an output of 1 both inputs are same and 0 if both are different.
